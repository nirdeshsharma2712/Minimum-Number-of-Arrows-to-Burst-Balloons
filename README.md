# üìä LeetCode Problem: Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

## üß© Problem Statement

There are some **spherical balloons** taped onto a flat wall that represents the `XY-plane`. The balloons are represented as a `2D` integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the `exact y-coordinates` of the balloons.
Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive `y-direction`) from different points along the `x-axis`. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is burst by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. 
Given the **array points**, return the **minimum** number of **arrows** that must be shot to burst all balloons.

> **Note :**
> - There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.



## üß† Approach: Greedy + Sorting

- First, `sort` the balloons by their **starting points**.
  
> **Traverse** through the list while tracking:
> - `mx -> maximum` of the current balloon‚Äôs **start point**
> - `mn -> minimum` of the current balloon‚Äôs **end point**

- If `mx > mn`, it means the balloons no longer **overlap** -> Shoot an arrow here!
  
- Increase **count**

- Reset `mx` & `mn` to the **current balloon‚Äôs interval**
  
- Finally, return `count + 1` (as we start from `0`).



## ‚úÖ Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

##### Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
##### Output: 2

##### Explanation: 
<pre> 
- The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
  
</pre>

### Example 2

##### Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
##### Output: 4

##### Explanation: 
<pre> 
- One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
  
</pre>

### Example 3

##### Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
##### Output: 2

##### Explanation: 
<pre> 
- The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
  
</pre>

## üõ†Ô∏è Constraints

- `1 <= points.length <= 10^5`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-2^31 <= xstart < xend <= 2^31 - 1`
